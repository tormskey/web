        using cloud for the others -->
        Certainly! Let’s break down each part:

        Function: A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It takes input (called arguments
        or parameters), processes it, and produces an output. Functions are essential for organizing code, improving
        readability, and avoiding redundancy.
        Description: In programming, a function typically has the following components:
        Name: A descriptive name that reflects its purpose (e.g., calculate_average, print_message).
        Parameters: Input values passed to the function (e.g., calculate_average(x, y)).
        Body: The actual code that defines what the function does.
        Return Value: The result or output produced by the function (e.g., return average).
        Conclusion: Functions are fundamental building blocks in programming. They allow us to modularize code, improve
        maintainability, and create efficient and organized programs. Whether you’re writing a simple calculator or a
        complex application, understanding functions is crucial. 🚀
